Program # 9

Write a Java program that accepts a positive long integer between 2 to 15, and then using the number, calculate its factorial (n!). Using do-while statement, make sure it only accepts a valid number (between 2 and 15) â€“ if an invalid number is entered, program should display the original instruction again, using while loop.

Hint: all variables should be declared as long.

Hint: After do-while loop for input validation, use for-loop to get the factorial

*** Sample output


Enter a between number 2 and 15:

15

Factorial of 15 is 1307674368000
